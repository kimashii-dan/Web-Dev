      The <strong>wolf</strong> (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the
      grey wolf or gray wolf, is a canine native to Eurasia and North America.
      More than thirty subspecies of <em>Canis</em> lupus have been recognized,
      including the dog and dingo, though grey wolves, as popularly understood,
      only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest
      wild extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished
      from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a
      shorter torso and a longer tail.
