    <p class="description">
      <strong>Japan</strong> is an island country in East Asia. Located in the
      <em>Pacific Ocean</em> off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, it
      is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of
      Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. <br />
      The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu,
      Shikoku, and Kyushu—and thousands of smaller islands, covering 377,975
      square kilometres (145,937 sq mi). Japan has a population of over 123
      million as of 2025, making it the eleventh-most populous country.

      The capital of Japan and its largest city is Tokyo; the Greater Tokyo Area
      is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37 million
      inhabitants as of 2024. Japan is divided into 47 administrative
      prefectures and eight traditional regions. About three-quarters of the
      country's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its
      agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal
      plains. The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making its islands
      prone to destructive earthquakes and tsunamis.
